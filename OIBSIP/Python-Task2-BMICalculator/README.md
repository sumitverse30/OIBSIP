
Build a Python program that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies it into health categories. Beginners build a command-line tool; advanced builds a full GUI application with data persistence and trend visualisation.
Tech Stack — Beginner: Python, input(), basic arithmetic Tech Stack — Advanced: Python, tkinter or PyQt5, matplotlib, sqlite3 or CSV file storage
Feature Checklist — Beginner Tier:
[ ] Prompt user for weight (kg) and height (m) via command line
[ ] Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height²)
[ ] Classify result into standard categories: Underweight (< 18.5), Normal (18.5–24.9), Overweight (25–29.9), Obese (≥ 30)
[ ] Display the BMI value rounded to 2 decimal places and the category
[ ] Input validation: reject non-numeric input and negative values with a helpful error message
Feature Checklist — Advanced Tier (includes all Beginner features, plus):
[ ] GUI window built with tkinter or PyQt5 — no command line
[ ] Input fields with labels for weight and height; a "Calculate" button
[ ] Result displayed in the GUI with colour-coded feedback (e.g., green = normal, red = obese)
[ ] Multi-user support: allow saving BMI records for different named users
[ ] Historical records stored in an SQLite database or CSV file
